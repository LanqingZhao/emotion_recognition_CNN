## Credits and Acknowledgement 
This project is based on Stanford CS231N project emotion recognition and Dr. Shaoyuan Xu's(https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cTzILkQAAAAJ&hl=en) research in HP research lab. The co-author of the codes is Chieh-En Li. The graduate student mentor was Dr.Shaoyuan Xu, and the professor of this VIP class is Prof. Jan Allebach. The project was done in Spring 2019. Some of the codes come from Stanford CS231N project and scikit-learning, and the idea of project was given by Dr. Shaoyuan Xu and Prof. Jan Allebach. Baekdu Choi, a graduate student of Prof. Allebach, also provided assistance.
## The overall of project
The project was to fine-tune an existing convolutional neural network and use it to classify 7 basic human emotions. The inital idea was to use caffe, a c++ based opensource framework, to train and complete the task. However, due to complications of installation and the limit of hardware, we used Keras on Tensorflow to complete the project.
The project contains code of data cleaning, data augmentation, and training. It also performs evaluation on test images generated by data augmentations. 
The original images are JAFFE and CK+, and we designed and generate augmented images. Additionally, we clean the data and relabel them to be Keras-compatiable.
